Rural water supplies for fighting fire
==========

Map data for rural water supplies suitable for fire department use, equipped with dry hydrants.

As residential communities grow and sprout larger homes, they frequently exceed the capacity of the water sources
 planned for use by fire departments in the event of a house fire.   This software displays the nearest water source,
 calculates the gallons per minute available, and plots a route from the scence of the fire to the water source.
